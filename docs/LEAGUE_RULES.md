## 3. Scoring System

Points-per-Minute Format:
Points are awarded based on the minutes a player logs on the court, emphasizing efficiency.
For example, a player who scores a point every minute gets 1 point per minute played.
The system also adjusts for stats like rebounds, assists, steals, etc. in a points-per-minute fashion.

## 4. Draft Rules

Draft Type:
The draft will be conducted in multiple stages:

The first round will take place via Slack and Google Hangouts over the course of 2-3 hours. Managers will have a set time to make their selections, and the draft will proceed with prompt notifications and discussions.

If time permits, the second round may be completed on the same day.

Autopick and express draft modes are available in case a manager cannot attend in real-time.

The remaining rounds (Rounds 3 and 4) will be conducted via Slack over a period of days. This allows flexibility for teams to make picks at their convenience, though they must adhere to a reasonable timeline to keep the draft moving.

Managers will be notified of their designated pick times and must select their players within the specified time window. If a manager misses their pick, autopick may be triggered, or they may be skipped until their next scheduled pick.

Draft Order:
The draft order is determined by the outcome of the DMCB draft lottery for non-playoff teams. The top four picks are determined by the lottery, with the remaining spots (5-16) determined by playoff seedings in reverse order.
Teams can trade draft picks before, during, or after the draft, subject to approval by the commissioner or competition committee.

Player Eligibility:
All NBA players are eligible for the draft, including those on two-way contracts or active free agents.
Teams must adhere to the salary cap and contract rules while making their selections to ensure compliance throughout the draft process.

Draft Strategy:
Managers should consider roster needs, salary cap management, and future potential when making selections.
Drafting can focus on positions (guards, forwards, centers) or overall team balance, but long-term strategies may be prioritized to build a competitive roster.

## 5. Trades & Transactions

Waivers:
Players can be picked up through a waiver system with customizable rules (e.g., FAAB or waiver priority).
Players on waivers are held for a certain period before being added to a team.

Trades are subject to veto by league members or commissioners.

Trade deadline: to be set before playoffs.
