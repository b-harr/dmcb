# 1. Salary Cap Overview
In the NBA, teams are subject to a salary cap that limits the total amount of money they can spend on player salaries. This is a hard cap in some cases (such as during the season), with some flexibility through mechanisms like the luxury tax and exceptions for certain types of contracts (e.g., rookie contracts or veteran minimum contracts).

For your league, you could implement a salary cap system that mirrors the NBA’s cap structure for each season, with fluctuations based on projected increases in the salary cap.

Annual Salary Cap: Teams cannot exceed this limit when signing or trading players.
Luxury Tax Threshold: If a team exceeds the salary cap by a certain amount, they pay a luxury tax (which should be a penalty system for over-spending).

# 2. Types of Contracts
In the NBA, players sign different types of contracts that affect both their salary and the team's cap space:

Rookie Contracts: Players drafted in the first round sign fixed-length contracts (typically 4 years) with specific salary increases.
Veteran Contracts: After their rookie contracts, players can sign extensions or veteran minimum contracts, which are lower in cost.
Max Contracts: Some players are eligible for "max contracts," which pay them the most money allowed under the cap, often based on years of service and prior salary.
Your fantasy league can mirror this by allowing contracts that match these categories:

4-Year Contracts for Rookies
Max Salary Contracts based on player status (e.g., based on their performance tier in your league).
Exceptions for contracts that may include cheaper deals for older or lower-tier players.

# 3. Salary Cap Rules
Contract Lengths: Contracts in your league should mirror those in the NBA, with most players signed for up to 3-4 years, similar to NBA rules.
Extensions: Teams should be able to extend contracts for a limited number of years, typically after the rookie deal expires.
Cap Holds: Teams can have cap holds on their players (e.g., the rights to a restricted free agent or a player who is on an expiring contract).

# 4. Salary Cap Exceptions
The NBA has several exceptions that allow teams to sign players beyond the salary cap. These exceptions include:

Mid-Level Exception: Teams can sign players for a set salary even if they are over the cap.
Bi-Annual Exception: Similar to the MLE but for a lower value.
Sign-and-Trade: This allows teams to trade players and still sign them to a contract while bypassing the cap.
You could implement a mid-level exception in your league, where teams can sign a free agent even if they are at the cap, though only under specific terms.

# 5. Trading Players & Contracts
The NBA's salary cap rules also involve restrictions when it comes to trading contracts:

Matching Salaries: When teams trade players, their combined salaries must match within a certain percentage.
Traded Player Exception: If a team receives less salary than they send out in a trade, they may have a certain amount of trade exception space that they can use to acquire a player with the saved cap space.
For your league, you could adapt the idea of matching contracts when making trades. For example, managers may only trade players if the trade is within a certain salary range or by using trade exceptions based on how they manage their team cap.

# 6. Buyouts and Waivers
Just like in the NBA, players may be waived or bought out, which allows them to become free agents, but their salaries often still count against the cap. You may want to have rules for how buyouts are managed in your fantasy league, along with the waiver system that handles free-agent signings.

# 7. Salary Cap Management & Penalties
To prevent teams from “gaming” the system, your league can impose penalties for teams that exceed the salary cap. This could take the form of:

Luxury Tax Payments: Teams above a certain salary threshold would pay a penalty, which could be redistributed among other teams in the league or used for specific purposes.
Cap Violations: Teams exceeding the salary cap without the proper exceptions could face fines or restrictions on future trades and contract signings.

# 8. Salary Cap Reset for Dynasty Leagues
For dynasty leagues like DMCB, you might consider adding a feature where teams must manage their cap over multiple seasons, particularly if players are being signed long-term. The key to managing a dynasty league’s salary cap is ensuring a balance between winning now and planning for the future.
