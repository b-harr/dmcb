## Section 2 – Teams & Rosters

### 2.1 Roster Size

* Each franchise must maintain a **minimum of 12 players** and may carry a **maximum of 15 players** under standard contracts.
* In addition, each franchise may carry up to **2 Two-Way Players**.
* **Two-Way Players**:

  * Occupy separate slots that do not count toward the 15-man roster limit.
  * Do not count against the salary cap if waived.

### 2.2 Active Lineup & Matchups

* **Fantasy Games & NBA Schedule**:

  * Each fantasy matchup is tied directly to the NBA schedule, producing **82 potential fantasy matchups per season**.
  * The DMCB season officially consists of **77 games**:

    * **Games 1–56**: Regular Season
    * **Games 57–63**: Playoffs, Round 1 (7 games)
    * **Games 64–70**: Playoffs, Round 2 (7 games)
    * **Games 71–77**: Finals (7 games)
  * **Games 78–82** are discarded and will not count toward fantasy results.

* **Matchup Mechanics**:

  * Matchups open on the first day any NBA team plays its designated numbered game and close once the last team has completed that same numbered game.
  * Example: Your Sports.ws matchup for *Game 12* consists of every player’s 12th NBA game, even if those games occur on different days. For example, in 2024-25 [Boston|https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/2025_games.html] was the first to play its 12th game on Mon, Nov 11, 2024, while [Denver|https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DEN/2025_games.html] was the last to play its 12th game on Sun, Nov 17, 2025. Fantasy rosters for Game 12 would lock at the start of the first game on Mon, Nov 11, 2024 at 7:00p, and Game 12 would become final at the end of the final game on Sun, Nov 17, 2025 at approx. 8:12p (ET).
  * Real-time scoring is provided by Sports.ws for paid leagues and is subject to availability.

* **Lineup Minutes Allocation**:

  * Each franchise must distribute lineup minutes as follows:

    * **96 Guard (G) minutes**
    * **96 Forward (F) minutes**
    * **48 Center (C) minutes**
  * Position eligibility is locked to **Sports.ws default designations**. No exceptions.

### 2.3 Contract Types

* **Rookie Contracts**: Players drafted in the Entry Draft enter the league on rookie-scale contracts (see Section 3).
* **Veteran Contracts**: Players signed in free agency or acquired by trade may be signed up to the maximum allowable length (see 2.5).
* **Extensions**: Teams may extend a player in the final year of a contract, subject to salary cap rules.
* **Options**: Team and Player Options are permitted, limited to one (1) year.
* **Two-Way Contracts**: See 2.1 above.

### 2.4 Salary Cap Structure

* The DMCB operates under a **salary cap** (see Section 2.5).
* Two-way contracts do not apply to the salary cap unless converted to standard contracts.
* When a player is waived from a standard contract, any guaranteed salary continues to apply to the cap (unless another team claims the player).

### 2.5 Contract Limits & Salary Cap

* **Salary Cap Basis**

  * The DMCB salary cap is set at **1.5× the NBA’s actual salary cap** for that season.
  * For **2025–26**, the NBA salary cap is **\$154,647,000**, resulting in a DMCB cap of **\$231,970,500**.

* **Options**
