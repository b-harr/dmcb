## Section 2 – Teams & Rosters

### 2.1 Roster Size

* Each franchise must maintain a **minimum of 12 players** and may carry a **maximum of 15 players** under standard contracts.
* In addition, each franchise may carry up to **2 Two-Way Players**.
* **Two-Way Players**:

  * Occupy separate slots that do not count toward the 15-man roster limit.
  * Do not count against the salary cap if waived.

### 2.2 Active Lineup & Matchups

* **Fantasy Games & NBA Schedule**:

  * Each fantasy matchup is tied directly to the NBA schedule, producing **82 potential fantasy matchups per season**.
  * The DMCB season officially consists of **77 games**:

    * **Games 1–56**: Regular Season
    * **Games 57–63**: Playoffs, Round 1 (7 games)
    * **Games 64–70**: Playoffs, Round 2 (7 games)
    * **Games 71–77**: Finals (7 games)
  * **Games 78–82** are discarded and will not count toward fantasy results.

* **Matchup Mechanics**:

  * Matchups open on the first day any NBA team plays its designated numbered game and close once the last team has completed that same numbered game.
  * Example: Your Sports.ws matchup for *Game 12* consists of every player’s 12th NBA game, even if those games occur on different days. For example, in 2024-25 [Boston](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/BOS/2025_games.html) was the first to play its 12th game on Mon, Nov 11, 2024, while [Denver](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/DEN/2025_games.html) was the last to play its 12th game on Sun, Nov 17, 2025. Fantasy rosters for Game 12 would lock at the start of the first game on Mon, Nov 11, 2024 at 7:00p, and Game 12 would become final at the end of the final game on Sun, Nov 17, 2025 at approx. 8:12p (ET).
  * Real-time scoring is provided by Sports.ws for paid leagues and is subject to availability.

* **Lineup Minutes Allocation**:

  * Each franchise must distribute lineup minutes as follows:

    * **96 Guard (G) minutes**
    * **96 Forward (F) minutes**
    * **48 Center (C) minutes**
  * Position eligibility is locked to **Sports.ws default designations**.
  * **No exceptions** to Sports.ws positional eligibility will be granted.

### 2.3 Contract Types

* **Rookie Contracts**: Players drafted in the Entry Draft enter the league on rookie-scale contracts (see Section 3).
* **Veteran Contracts**: Players signed in free agency or acquired by trade may be signed up to the maximum allowable length (see 2.5).
* **Extensions**: Teams may extend a player in the final year of a contract, subject to salary cap rules.
* **Options**: Team and Player Options are permitted, limited to one (1) year.
* **Two-Way Contracts**: See 2.1 above.

---

## Section 3 - Contracts & Salary Cap

### 3.1 Salary Cap Structure

* The DMCB operates under a **salary cap** (see Section 3.2).
* Two-way contracts do not apply to the salary cap unless converted to standard contracts.
* When a player is waived from a standard contract, any guaranteed salary continues to apply to the cap (unless another team claims the player).

### 3.2 Contract Limits & Salary Cap

* **Salary Cap Basis**

  * The DMCB salary cap is set at **1.5× the NBA’s actual salary cap** for that season.
  * For **2025–26**, the NBA salary cap is **\$154,647,000**, resulting in a DMCB cap of **\$231,970,500**.
  * This cap will automatically adjust each year in accordance with NBA cap announcements. See the league spreadsheet for the latest figures.

* **Team Salary**

  * Teams may not exceed the cap except under permitted exceptions (see Section 3.1).
  * Teams are not required to maintain a minimum payroll.

* **Extensions**

  * Teams may extend a player entering the final year of their contract for up to **4 additional years**, subject to max salary rules.

* **Options**

  * Contracts may include **Player or Team Options** for **1 additional year**.
  * A contract may not include both a Player Option and Team Option.
  * Owners must notify the Commissioner of exercised or declined Team Options by a league-set deadline (typically one week prior to the annual Draft). Failure to respond by the deadline will result in the contract being deemed accepted and the player retained.

* **Restricted Free Agents (RFAs) and Cap Holds**

  * If an NBA player is a Restricted Free Agent and has not signed by the DMCB Draft, Spotrac’s published Cap Hold will be applied to the fantasy team’s payroll until the NBA contract is signed.
  * Upon signing, the Cap Hold will be replaced with the actual contract terms. Owners then have three (3) days to decide whether to keep or release the player. If no decision is communicated, the player is retained by default.

* **Two-Way Contracts**

  * Two-way players do not count against the salary cap unless converted to standard contracts.
  * If converted, their salary must fit within the team’s cap and roster limits.

### 3.3 Scoring System

Points-per-Minute Format:
Points are awarded based on the minutes a player logs on the court, emphasizing efficiency.
For example, a player who scores a point every minute gets 1 point per minute played.
The system also adjusts for stats like rebounds, assists, steals, etc. in a points-per-minute fashion.

```
FP = PTS + TRB + AST + STL + BLK - TOV - PF - TF  
------------------------------------------------  
FP  = Fantasy Points  
PTS = Points          (+1)  
TRB = Total Rebounds  (+1)  
AST = Assists         (+1)  
STL = Steals          (+1)  
BLK = Blocks          (+1)  
TOV = Turnovers       (-1)  
PF  = Personal Fouls  (-1)  
TF  = Technical Fouls (-1)  
```

```
FPPG = FP / G  
-------------  
FPPG = Fantasy Points Per Game  
FP = Fantasy Points  
G = Games  
```

```
FPPM = FP / MP  
--------------  
FPPM = Fantasy Points Per Minute  
FP = Fantasy Points  
MP = Minutes Played  
```

```
FPR = FPPG * FPPM  
-----------------  
FPR = Fantasy Point Rating  
FPPG = Fantasy Points Per Game  
FPPM = Fantasy Points Per Minute  
```

```
FPV = FPR / $1M  
---------------  
FPV = Fantasy Point Value  
FPR = Fantasy Point Rating  
$1M = Salary (in millions)  
```
